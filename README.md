# Snake Game using Python

This project is to build a snake game using Python

I have used Spyder (Python 3.9, from anaconda navigator) IDE to run this Pygame and have successfully finished the project.

This Python file can be imported and run in any Python IDE which supports Pygame (prefarably in Spyder).
